			My name is Rui Xue, and student of Universaity of Nebreaska at Omaha. Major is Management Information System and I am from China. I am a crazy game fan, I strong suggest the The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild which is from Nitendo. Pretty free when you playing this game and you goona can found something suprised when you hanging around in this game.

	Also, I love cooking and I like to taste from other countries. I started cooking when I was 7, and my grandma is my first teacher to teach how to cook. Because I dislike to leave my soft and comfortable chair, I am struggling on overweight.
